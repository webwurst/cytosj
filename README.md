# CYtoSJ - Compose YAML to Swarm JSON

Translate [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)'s [YAML files](https://docs.docker.com/compose/yml/) into [Giant Swarm](https://giantswarm.io/)'s [JSON configuration](http://docs.giantswarm.io/reference/swarm-json/).

## Install

Requires the `yaml` package, which can be installed using

```
pip install pyyaml
```

Please use sudo to install globally.

Proper installation via Pypi and `pip` may follow.

## Usage:

```
python cytosj.py -n myapp path/to/docker-compose.yml
```

This will generate a JSON file in the same directory holding the source file, named accordingly.

Use `-h` for details.

## Features

* Translates most compose YAML files to ready-to-use application configuration JSON files
* Shows hints and warnings if details from the source can't be translated

## Known limitations

* `build` is not supported
* `expose` is ignored (currently)
* `env_file` is ignored (currently)
* `extends` is ignored (currently)
* `entrypoint` is ignored (currently)
* `external_links` is ignored (and probably will be forever)
* `volumes_from` is ignored (since not supported by Giant Swarm)
* Also ignores `net`, `pid`, `dns`, `cap_add`, `cap_drop`, `dns_search`, `working_dir`, `user`, `hostname`, `domainname`, `mem_limit`, `privileged`, `restart`, `stdin_open`, `tty`, `cpu_shares`
* If a dependency points to a component with multiple `ports` entries, the first port is used for that dependency automatically.
* Circular references will be translated to JSON, but won't work with Giant Swarm. There won't be a warning for now.
